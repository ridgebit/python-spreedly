python-spreedly is a wrapper around the [Spreedly API](https://spreedly.com). It wraps the most common Spreedly functions, such as creating subscribers, getting subscription plans, etc. It comes with a full set of unit tests which can be invoked by running `$ python spreedly.py`.

This code is a part of [Ping Brigade](https://www.pingbrigade.com/). It was created because the other API wrappers available at the time of writing it lacked internal consistency or were not very straightforward to use. See COPYING for license details.
